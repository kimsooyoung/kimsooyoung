### [Kim Soo Young](https://kimsooyoung.github.io/)

> Hi, I'm Sooyoung Kim. And I'm robotics enthusiast

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Developing advanced robotic systems and software at the intersection of real-time control, perception, and AI. My recent work includes high-precision AMR software, imitation learning for manipulators, and radar-based sensing systems for robots.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Deep reinforcement learning, advanced robotics algorithms, and systems integration using ROS 2, with a strong focus on real-time applications and embedded AI.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Robotics projects involving manipulation, autonomous navigation, or sensor fusionâ€”especially ones that push the boundaries of real-world deployment.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Building robust simulation-to-reality pipelines and optimizing ML models for edge deployment in robotics.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: NVIDIA Isaac Sim, ROS/ROS 2, autonomous mobile robots, robotic manipulation, mmWave radar integration, or anything related to C++/Python-based robotic software systems.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sooyouk5@uci.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™ve built autonomous robots that can ride elevators and manipulate complex objectsâ€”and once helped raise a $14.8M investment for a micromobility startup.
